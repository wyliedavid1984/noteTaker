Created an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application uses an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.
I used several technologies beyond express to help with the application.

## Technologies

<details>
<summary>Expand to see technologies used</summary>

### Javascript

The index.js file was provided so that we could work with html.  It made use of jQuery.

#### Node

I used node to initialize package.json. After the initialization, I added express via NPM.  Also used node to run the local server instance. I also required a few built-in modules as well as making one of my own.

#### NPM

I used npm to install the dependency express that did most of the heavy lifting for this application

#### Express

Express made coding this application much easier. I made use of the express function through a variable named app.  It help to reduce the amount of code need to make request and response.  I built to main routes files. One to deal with apis and the second to deal with html.  In the html routes we main just did get requests to grab the two different html pages that were stored in the views folder. 

### CSS

I made use of all the bootstraps classes to style the html.

### HTML

All the html was provided.  I add some additional spacing, and style provided by bootstrap.  Each html was setup to generate by the job class.

## Usages

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
